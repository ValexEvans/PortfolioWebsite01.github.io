                            For the original website design, Figma was used. HTML and CSS were then employed to build
                            the web-pages. Finally, the website was hosted on GitHub.</a>

                        <a><b>Compound Planetary Reducer:<br></b>
                            I used Fusion 360 to design a hand and reducer for a robotic prosthetic hand company. The
                            goal
                            of the project was to increase the grip strength of the hand. The reducer I designed was a
                            compound planetary reducer, consisting of two planetary reducers with a 1:3 and 1:4 gear
                            ratio,
                            respectively, for a total ratio of 1:12. The hand and reducer were 3D printed in PLA and
                            assembled.</a>

                            I used Autodesk Inventor to design and put together a 3D printed hand. I also programmed a
                            C++-based microcontroller and paired it with an EMG sensor, which allowed me to control the
                            hand
                            with muscle movements.</a>
